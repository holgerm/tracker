# Tracker App

## Purpose

This mobile app shall help me (and perhaps others) to track time spent for diverse projects, e.g. work projects, private activities etc.

I plan to support some agile techniques e.g. task estimation, value estimation etc.

This app should serve three purposes for me:

1. a showcase for my Flutter & Dart programming skills, since I offer development and coaching.
2. an app that helps me track my work and private activities.
3. an app that helps me earn my living.

I develop this app completely as open software, although I hope, that I will offer it for purchase someday, if it is good enough.

## Versions

### Version 0.2 (ongoing)

This version will be published as open beta. Hence we need some upgrades:

1. Edit function (adds to long click menu) that allows to change the name.
2. Nicer UI - Concept needed.
3. A Widget showing the current task(s). Here is a concept needed, too.

### Version 0.1

The first version of the Tracker app simply offers to add tasks, and activate / deactivate them. Each task can represent a project. When you work on a project, activate the according task by touch. When you finish working touch it again to deactivate it. You can activate multiple tasks at the same time. Each task shows how much time you spent on it so far.

#### What's still missing

1. ~~Task must be clickable~~
2. ~~Task model needs active/passive state~~
3. ~~Task needs timer that accumulates time while active~~
4. ~~Persistence for all task states.~~
6. ~~Remove existing tasks.~~
7. ~~Provide as internal App for either iOS or Android or both~~
8. ~~Add Reset Option for each Task.~~
