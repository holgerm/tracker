# Purpose

This mobile app shall help me (and perhaps others) to track time spent for diverse projects, e.g. work projects, private activities etc.

I plan to support some agile techniques e.g. task estimation, value estimation etc.

This app should serve three purposes for me:

1. a showcase for my Flutter & Dart programming skills, since I offer development and coaching.
2. an app that helps me track my work and private activities.
3. an app that helps me earn my living.

I develop this app completely as open software, although I hope, that I will offer it for purchase someday, if it is good enough.
